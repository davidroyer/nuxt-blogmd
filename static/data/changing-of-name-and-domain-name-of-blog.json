The .win domain name renewal fee is 7 yuan a year, .bid is 5 yuan a year; and if registered, both are 4 yuan a year, .win is 18 yuan 3 years, .bid is 14 yuan 3 years. Although .bid is cheap, I checked it. Its meaning is related to “auction”, so I chose the .win domain name of 18 yuan for 3 years.</p>\n<p>When placing an order, the mobile phone APP can be reduced by 5 yuan for the first time, so the final result is that the domain name “gplane.win” has been obtained for only 3 years.</p>\n<p>Because it is no longer the original “<a href=\"http://sealfu.cf\">sealfu.cf</a>” domain name, so the site name should be changed, and you will change the “Me.blog(‘GPlane’);”</p>\n"}
