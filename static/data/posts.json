The line at the beginning of <code>#</code> is a comment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lockfile-version\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#lockfile-version\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> lockfile version</h2>\n<p>The second line of each <code>yarn.lock</code> is <code># yarn lockfile v1</code>. This indicates the first version of the lockfile. The record version is for the purpose of updating the syntax or semantics of the lockfile in the future. Once the lockfile is updated in the future, the version number is added, and Yarn can make different actions according to different versions, thus ensuring backward compatibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"field-interpretation\"><a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#field-interpretation\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a> Field Interpretation</h2>\n<p>All package information is listed under the <code>yarn.lock</code> file and sorted alphabetically. I just find a bag for explanation. E.g:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\"><div class=\"hljs\"><span class=\"hljs-string\">Boom@5.x.x:</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">Version</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"5.2.0\"</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-string\">Responsible</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"https://registry.yarnpkg.com/boom/-/boom-5.2.0.tgz#5dd9da6ee3a5f302077436290cb717d3f4a54e02\"</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-attr\">  Dependencies:</span>\n    <span class=\"hljs-string\">Hoek</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"4.x.x\"</span>\n</div></code></pre>\n"

The .win domain name renewal fee is 7 yuan a year, .bid is 5 yuan a year; and if registered, both are 4 yuan a year, .win is 18 yuan 3 years, .bid is 14 yuan 3 years. Although .bid is cheap, I checked it. Its meaning is related to “auction”, so I chose the .win domain name of 18 yuan for 3 years.</p>\n<p>When placing an order, the mobile phone APP can be reduced by 5 yuan for the first time, so the final result is that the domain name “gplane.win” has been obtained for only 3 years.</p>\n<p>Because it is no longer the original “<a href=\"http://sealfu.cf\">sealfu.cf</a>” domain name, so the site name should be changed, and you will change the “Me.blog(‘GPlane’);”</p>\n"
